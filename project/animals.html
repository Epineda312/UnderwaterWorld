	<p> Fish</p>
	<P> <img src="fish.jpg" width="180 px" height="200"/>Most  Fish are cold blooded animals.Some of them are mammals and some of them lay eggs to give birth to their babies. The are lots of types of fish that live in the sea.

Different types of fish live in different parts of the ocean. Some live close to coral reefs. Some live near the surface. Some even live in the deep waters close to the bottom of the ocean. Fish eat a variety of things, from plants, plankton (small living organisms), to even other fish.

	<h6> What are Sharks?</h6>
	<p span class="sharkBio">Sharks are a group of fish characterized by their cartilaginous skeleton.
	They also have five to seven gill slits, and pectoral fins that are not directly connected to the head.
	Sharks came about around 350 million years ago and have not changed at all for about the last 70 million years.
	They live in an environment that is very resistant to change and they have not been majorly affected
	by humans until recent times. Their success is largely due to their original traits that they picked up from their more “primitive” ancestors.
	This gives sharks some amazing adaptations.
	It is thought that sharks evolved from “placoderms”. Placoderms are a group of primitive jawed fishes. It took a long series of successful
	as well as unsuccessful variations with fin, jaw positions etc. to give us all the different shapes and sizes of the sharks around today.

	<h6>Shark Habitat</h6>
	<p>Sharks are at the top of
	their food chain and they keep their ecosystem in balance by regulating populations of various fish species found under them. 
	Sharks have a very small number of natural predators which lets them to move freely to
	new locations when food becomes scare. They are loners for most part of their lives
	so they don’t travel in packs.</p>
	
	<h6>Shark Distribution</h6>
	<p>A lot of people think that sharks are only able to survive in salt water. However, they can be
	found in bodies of water all over the world. Sharks live in almost any part of the oceans. From
	lagoons to the deep sea, with the occasional river and lake. Their habitats can range from the 
	icy waters at the poles to the tropical regions with water temperatures of more than 30°C. </p>
	
	<h6>What Do Sharks Eat</h6>
	<p>Sharks mainly eat smaller fish but some species eat seals, sea lions, and various other marine mammals. 
	Sharks have been known to attack humans when they are curious. If a shark sees a human splashing in the water,
	it may try to investigate, leading to an accidental attack. The wide distribution of sharks in almost all seas and their successful existence for millions of years are
	due to sharks improvising and making use of many different food sources</p>
	
	<h6>Shark Reproduction</h6>
	<p>The info on reproductive strategies sharks use is still very limited.
	This variety is why its hard for marine biologists to make assumptions on their reproductive
	methods. Sharks have been able to adapt their reproduction methods to the most different conditions.
	Majority of sharks have live births, while others lay eggs. Several shark species can mate for the entire year, others
	prefer certain seasons and locations. The females of several species of sharks bear young each year, others can stop reproducing
	at different intervals which can go on for years.</p>

	<div id="shark2alignright">
	<h6>Shark Anatomy</h6>
	<p>There are more than 300 different species of sharks in the ocean but they all 
	share the same basic anatomy. Alongside sharks, which are characterized as cartilaginous fish, most of the fish in the sea are what marine biologists would consider "bony fish". 
	Although both of them are considered fish since they share distinct similarities such as having fins and gills there are quite a few things that differentiate these two distinct types of 
	“fish” from each other. </p>
	
	<h6>Shark Evolution</h6>
	<p>Sharks have swum in the oceans for almost 450 million years now. How long they have been able to stick around is just part of their story!
	That extra few million years of evolution have led to many shark species developing some extraordinary 
	abilities as perfect predators. From their skeletons made of cartilage, to the shape and sharpness of their teeth, everything has been fine 
	tuned to make sharks the successful predators they are today. </p>
	</div>
	
	<h6>Shark Social Structure</h6>
	<p>Sharks are loners, plain and simple. Sharks don’t live in groups, even the offspring are to take
	care of themselves from the minute they are born. Since they don’t spend much time
	together there is really no reason for them to have a social hierarchy.
	</p>

	<h6>Sharks Endangered</h6>
	<p>Many types of sharks are at risk of becoming extinct.
	Unfortunately, hunting is the main reason why sharks are getting closer and closer to extinction.</p>
	
	<h6>Shark Hunting</h6>
	<p>Sharks come in all sizes and are very fascinating creatures. Sadly, large numbers of sharks have been hunted over the years. Sharks can be described as top predators. This causes them to
	have a lower population than other species of fish. Sharks also have slow growth rates, mature late in life,
	and produce little offspring. These characteristics mixed with overfishing can lower population numbers to a point where recovery can take decades.
	Quite a few species of sharks have been overfished and are now protected by law.</p>
	
	<h6>Why defend the sharks?</h6>
	<p>They are not some mindless human eating creatures like the movies have made everyone believe</p>
