<h3>Algae</h3>

<p>There are 3 different types of algae which are classified as eukaryotic. Brown Algae(the Phaeophyta), Red Algae(the Rhodophyta), and Green Algae(the Chlorophyta).<br> 
Algae has many different species and comes in many different shapes and sizes, but the most common type of species of algae is commonly known as seaweed.<br>
Even though Brown Algae, Red Algae, and Green Algae are all classified as algae they all come from different kingdoms.<br>
Brown Algae comes from the chromists kingdom, Red Algae comes from the protist kingdom, and Green Algae comes from the Plantae kingdom.
Red Algae and Brown Algae are mostly marine algae, while Green Algae is both marine and freshwater algae.

<h3>Brown Algae</h3>

<p>Brown Algae is fairly large with about 2000 species, and is the most complex type of algae. Brown Algae is most commonly deep brown or golden brown in color.<br>
Many types or seaweeds are classified as brown algae, another form of brown algae commonly known to people is kelp which can be used as food.<br>
Brown Algae is the largest type of algae which species can grow up to 60m. With algae is abundant and large in size brown algae can create under water forest.<br>
All species of brown algae are multicellular. Brown algae is the only type of algae to be only multicellular.<br>
Brown algae is often attached to another structure such as a dock, rock, or shell. The free flowing brown algae tend to float to the surface to absorb sunlight.<br>

<h3>Red Algae</h3>

<p>Red algae are one of the oldest and largest tyoes of algae. There are about 6000 species of red algae.<br>
Red algae can be red or purplish in color because red algae contains a variety of pigments.<br> 
can range from single cellular to multicellular to plant like species which get their energy by photosynthesis<br>
Red algae is most commonly found in tide pool and coral reefs.<br>
Coralline algae is a type of algae that helps build tropical coral reefs.<br>
</p>

<h3>Green Algae</h3>
<img src="Green.jpg" alt="Green Algae" width="350" height="300">
<p>Green algae has both marine and freshwater species which range from single cellular to complex multicellular species.<br>
Green algae may live in large colonies, and they are also capable of photosynthesis.<br>
Green algae is classified in the plant kingdom(Plantae) unlike brown and red algae which are in other kingdoms.<br>
Green algae can vary from dark green to light green. Its green color comes from containing chlorophyll a and b.<br>
Green algae serves as a great food source to much of marine life.<br>
