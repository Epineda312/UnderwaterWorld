	<p class="sharkBio">&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharks came about around 350 million years ago and have stayed the same for
	the past 70 million years. Although they live in an
	environment that is resistant to change and have not been majorly affected by humans
	until now, to survive for this long they must be doing something right.
	Their success is largely due to the original traits they inherited from their more primitive
	ancestors. This gives sharks some amazing adaptations. It is thought that sharks evolved from
	placoderms, a group of primitive jawed fishes.
	It took a long series of successful and unsuccessful mutations with fin, jaw positions etc. to give us
	all the different shapes and sizes of the sharks around today. 
	However many people do not realize the sheer amount of diversity in the shape of sharks, or that rays are really sharks.

	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Habitat</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sharks have very few natural predators which allow them to freely move to
	new habitats when food is scarce. They are loners for most part of their lives
	so they don’t travel together.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Distribution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Many people believe that sharks only live in the oceans. However, they are
	distributed in bodies of water &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found all over the world.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>What Do Sharks Eat</li>
	</ul>
	<p> <span class="eat">Many people ask what do sharks eat and the answer is it greatly depends on the
	species of shark and the habitat it lives in.</span></p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Reproduction</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There hasn’t been much research conducted in regards to shark reproduction 
	but a great deal is know about the process. The conception generally takes place
	privately in the waters of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ocean</p>

	<div id="shark2alignright">
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Anatomy</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are more than 300 different species of sharks in the ocean but they all 
	share the same basic anatomy. Anatomic shark characteristics have made them ruthless predators.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Tails</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Images of the most common types of shark tails. Tails are important part of shark
	anatomy which help them to achieve fast swimming speeds.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Communication</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sharks engage in different forms of communication. Although sharks are loners,
	they have the intelligence to communicate.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Evolution</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sharks have been on Earth for almost 450 million years, although modern sharks 
	have evolved for 100 million years.</p>

	<div id="shark3alignleft">
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Social Structure</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sharks are loners and there is no other social structure than survival for the 
	fittest.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">	
	<li>Sharks Endangered</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Many types of sharks are at risk of becoming extinct which is why conservation efforts are in place.
	Keeping pollution and human food items out of the waters is very important.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Shark Hunting</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sharks come in all sizes and they are very fascinating creatures that live in waters all over the world. 
	However, many of them have been hunted in large numbers over the years</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Sharks and Global Warming</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There are several species of sharks being affected by global warming</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
	<li>Why defend the sharks?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>They are no human-eating creatures like the television or movies have made us believe</p>
