<h6>Frequently Asked Questions</h6>
<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
     <p>We have been a group of students working together on a project for school.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Who Funds Us?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Currently we cover the costs ourselves.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Why Is The Ocean Blue?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>There are different possibilities as to why the ocean is 
	blue. Scientists believe that when the sun shines on seawater, one part 
	of the white light is absorbed and the other reflected. White light is made up of
	various shades of color. Seawater does not absorb blue
	light, so the blue light is reflected outwards. Another possible theory is suspended 
	matter in the sea is responsible for its blue color. </p>
      </div>
	  <h2>What Causes Waves?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
     <p>Wind is generally the main cause of surface waves. The longer the distance the wind travels, 
	the stronger it becomes. As a result, the bigger the waves. As wind travels over the ocean, it tends to pick up some 
	of the water. Because the surface of the water can't move, it rises. Gravity pulls the wave back down 
	towards the ocean. Now the water has momentum.
	Pressure from below pushes the water back up, and the cycle starts again. </p>
      </div>
      <h2>How Many Oceans Are There In The World?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>There is really only one big ocean. All the oceans are connected by seas. Oceans are separated and known by regions.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>What Are The Main "Oceans" Called?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>There are 5 main areas of ocean:</p>
		<ul>
    <li> The Pacific Ocean </li>
    <li> The Atlantic Ocean </li>
    <li> The Arctic Ocean surrounds the North Pole. 
	It is the smallest "ocean". It is frozen all the time, except at its edges.</li> 
	<li>The Indian Ocean is the third largest area. </li>
	<li>The Southern Ocean is where you would find the South Pole and Antarctica.</li>
	</ul>	
      </div>
	  <h2>What Is A Sea?</h2>
	  <div class="answer">
     <p>A sea is a body of water that "branches" between one of the five oceans. </p>
      </div>
      <h2>What Are The Largest Seas?</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <ol>
		<li> The South China Sea </li>
		<li> The Caribbean Sea </li>
		<li> The Mediterranean Sea </li>
		</ol>
      </div>
	  <h2>Why Is The Ocean Salty?</h2>
	  <div class="answer">
	  <p>Its quite simple actually. It has a lot of salt in it! Salt is a rather common mineral in nature
	that is found in soil and rocks.. 
	Flowing water picks up some salt and carries it to rivers. 
	Rivers carry this salt to the seas. Since this has been happening for millions of years now,
	the oceans hold tons of salt.</p>
